Welcome to the Freescale world of embedded systems tools. 
We've got a lot of great tips for getting the most out of our tools, so leave Tip of the Day turned on for a while.
If you turn Tip of the Day off, it is available from the Help menu.

You can get access to the online documentation provided with the IDE menu Help > CodeWarrior Help.
Inside there, you will find as well many FAQs related to the product.

If you have comments about this product or suggestions for future versions, you can send e-mail to 'cw_support@freescale.com'.

If the tool gives an error message, correct it directly in the message window.

In order to clone a build target, switch the project to the Targets view. Then select the menu entry Project->Create target. 
In the New Target dialog, select Clone existing target and the target to be cloned.
Don't forget to change the output file name in the Linker preference panel for one of the two build targets.

You can find the latest information about this product on the WorldWide Web at 'http://www.codewarrior.com'.

In the Errors and Warnings window, click on the Information button to hide all informations, so only the warnings and errors remain. 
Clicking a second time does show them again.
The same feature also works with the Warning and the Error button for these types of messages.

The recommended way to generate a new project is to use the New Project Wizard. 
Use File->New (or Ctrl-Shift-N) click on the Project Tab and Select the New Project Wizard for your core.

You can search all online help files with Help->Search.
This does search in the combined documentation of the IDE, the compiler, linker, the release notes and also of the debugger.

You can configure your own keyboard shortcuts with Edit->Command and Key Bindings.

To start the debugger, simply press F5.

The check box "Save project entries using relative paths" in the Target Settings preference panel configures whether the IDE stores the path together with a source file.
Use this if multiple directories in the search path do contain a file with the same name. 
However usually its better to avoid this situation all together.

In the Access Paths preference panel, clicking on a folder symbol just at the left of the directory name means to search also in all subdirectories.
Choosing a directory with many subdirectories can considerably slow down the compilation.

In the Access Paths preference panel, the user paths are searched for the syntax #include "filename.h".
The system paths are searched for the #include <incl.h> and for the #include "file.h" syntax.

In the Access Paths preference panel, the first symbol on every access path line can be used to disable an access path without removing it.
One use of this is to check if a certain path is necessary at all. 
First build the project, then disable the access path any press Apply. If now the ide wants to rebuild certain files, this access path is used.

In the Access Paths preference panel, paths can be copied between different projects or build targets. 
Select the src path, Press Ctrl-C, click in the destination panel and press Ctrl-V.

In the Access Paths preference panel, paths can be dragged and dropped between different projects or build targets.

In the IDE Preferences you can configure how many spaces wide one tab should indent.
Select on Edit->Preferences in the menu and select the Font & Tabs entry for the Editor.

With the Find In Files (Ctrl-Shift-m) you can search and replace in multiple files in a directory,in the files of a project, in the symbolics or in the opened files.

The "Use modification date caching" entry in the Build Extras project preference panel controls whether the ide checks during a build if files were modified externally. If you are using any external build stage, do not check this entry.

If you either want to copy/move a project or to report a problem to technical support, there is the Pack&&Go wizard you can use for this. You find this wizard in the CodeWarrior help menu.

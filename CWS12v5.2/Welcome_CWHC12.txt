LIMITATIONS:  

WINDOWS SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS:

The following limitations are applicable only if you are installing the product on Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10:

(1) During installation, security messages may pop up concerning drivers being installed. It is highly recommended to click on the option "continue anyway..", so the driver can be installed.

(2) When opening the Codewarrior components (IDE, Debugger etc.) Firewall warnings may appear with the option to block or unblock the application. It is advisable to click on the unblock option to continue.



GENERAL LIMITATIONS:

The following limitations are applicable to Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10 :

 (1) It is highly recommended to have at least 400 MB of free space on the Windows system disk.

(2) The memory banker does not work with projects that include Processor Expert or OSEK.

(3) The Debugger has a limitation on expression that could be evaluated. If the address arithmetic in an ORTI file is too complex, the debugger will display an error, “issue loading ORTI file”. To work around this issue, simplify the      address arithmetic used in the ORTI file..

(4) There is known limitation with the current version of the firmware for the Multilink, Cyclone Pro, and OSBDM. On several of the newer HCS12 devices, including the I/P/G/HY series, if the bus frequency is substantially lower than the BDC frequency(VCO/8), the hardware interface will lose communications with the target. 
The current work around is to ensure that the bus frequency meets or exceeds VCO/8 on these devices.

(5) The references for devices which were supported in the CodeWarrior Development Studio for the S12(X) Microcontrollers V5.1, but not supported in current version, could appear in documentation. Those references should be ignored.

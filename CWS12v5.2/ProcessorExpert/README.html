<H3>Installation</H3>
<p>
Processor Expert is installed as part of the CodeWarrior. Please follow the instruction while
installing CodeWarrior. Enable or disable the installation of Processor Expert can be done
by selecting Custom installation of the CodeWarrior and selecting / deselecting appropriate
components of Processor Expert.<br/>
<p>
Processor Expert main directory will be installed within CodeWarrior
to "{CodeWarrior}\ProcessorExpert" directory.<br/>
<p>
Processor Expert plug-in is started in CodeWarrior IDE when a Processor Expert project is opened or a new Processor expert project is created.
<p>
<p>
<H3>About license.dat</H3>
<p>
To run Processor Expert in FULL version is necessary to obtain License.dat
which is located in Code-Warrior root directory. Without the valid license
Processor Expert runs in DEMO mode and CPU component generates only initialization
code and interrupt vector table. Generated code in DEMO mode is assumed to be
used for presentation purposes only.<br/>
<p>
The FULL version of Processor Expert supports several component packages (see chapter CONTENT).
Each package needs separate license. Detailed information about licences can be found at:
<a href="http://www.freescale.com/codewarrior" target=new>http://www.freescale.com/codewarrior</a> in 'CodeWarrior Suites' section
<p>
<p>
<H2>B. CONTENT</H2>

<p>
<H3>Processor Expert limitations:</H3>
<UL>
<li> XGATE features are not supported (HCS12X family)
<li> Some window relating functions may not work properly
<li> The IntFlash component is not fully tested for ECC mode of the FLASH memory.
<li> Components are not tested for MC9S12KT256, MC9S12KT128 and MC9S12KG128 derivatives on development boards.
<li> Components are not tested on MC9S12XEP100 in 208pin package
<li> If IIC module is used together with 10-bit addressing mode, it is recommended to check errata of the CPU. Some of the errata may cause communication failure in this mode.
<li> Freescale has decided to rename "Embedded beans" to "Embedded components" to avoid any confusion with Java Beans. If you find references to "bean" or "embedded bean", please understand that these terms are equivalent to "component" and "embedded component" respectively.
<li> FreescaleEthernetAPI and FreescaleMAC components code are not MISRA compliant and were not checked for MISRA compliance. These components are not included in MISRA compliance matrix.
<li> Functionality of DIENL register in S12VR was not tested with silicon.

<p>The Component Assistant is a mode of Components Library window. It guides the user during the selection of components - basic application building blocks. The user answers a series of questions that finally lead to a selection of a component that suits best for a required function. In this mode the Components Library window has the following parts: <ul><li class="normli">Control bar with the history navigation buttons and the history line showing answers for already answered questions. The user can walk through the history using the arrow buttons and by clicking the individual items </li><li class="normli">A box with a current question.</li><li class="normli">A list of available answers for the current question.<br /> If the answer already corresponds to a single component (it has an icon of the component and there is a [component name] at the end of the list line) and user double-clicks it, its added into the project. Also a <b>pop-up menu</b> of the component, allowing to add it into the project or show it's documentation, is available on right mouse button click on the line (for details see  help page).<br /> If more questions are necessary for the component selection, the line with the answer contains a group icon <img  src="images/beanassist_groupicon.png" width="12" /> and a in a brackets a number of components that still can possibly be selected. After clicking on such line a next question is displayed. </li></ul></p><p><span class="note">Please note that a component filtering, controlled by the button(s) on the bottom bar of the Components library window, works in this mode too. The questions and answers are filtered so the components that do not suit to the enabled filter(s) are not visible. Notice that enabling of the filtering might remove some components from the list. If the 'All questions' filter button is not pressed and there is only one answer available, the question is automatically skipped like the user would select an answer. For details please see the Components library help page. </span></p><p><span class="note">This mode of Components Library doesn't offer addition of CPU components. If you would like to add another CPU component, please switch to another Components Library tab. </span></p>

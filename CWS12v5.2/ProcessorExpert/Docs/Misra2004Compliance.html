This document contains MISRA C 2004 Compliance exceptions and documented features for Processor Expert generated code.
The document contains chapter for each supported microcontroller architecture.
Each chapter contains: <ul>
<li>documentation required or recommended by MISRA standard;</li>
<li>general exceptions, which apply across all embedded components;</li>
<li>component exceptions associated with certain embedded component;</li>
<li>PC-Lint configuration used for MISRA validation.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The MISRA compliance was checked using PC-Lint tool, so it is possible to find exceptions as a comment also in the generated code.

        <td>All usage of implementation-defined behavior shall be documented.</td>
        <td><ul>
             <li>Follows the list of implementation dependent behavior used in Processor Expert. See documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools for more information on topics not specified below:</li>
             <li>Startup function of the application is 'void _EntryPoint(void)' function, see <a href="ResetScenario.html">Reset Scenario</a>. HCS12(X) derivatives have two additional reset vectors: If clock monitor is enabled and clock monitor reset occurred, 'void _ClockMonitor_EntryPoint(void)' function is startup function of the application. 'void _COP_EntryPoint(void)' is startup function of the application if COP is enabled and COP reset occurred.</li>
             <li>Program is finished at the end of main function in the infinite loop.</li>
             <li>Execution character set and corresponding values are documented in rule 3.2 in this table.</li>
             <li>Identifiers of registers sometimes have more than 31 characters to comply with the reference manual of the derivative. The number of significant initial characters in an identifier for CodeWarrior S12(X) compiler is 32,767 according to documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>
             <li>'Plain' char type (char_t) is unsigned by default setting of the compiler. The type is used in BWimage, COLimage, StringList and Term components.</li>
             <li>Signed integers are used in BWimage, COLimage, Term and PWMMC components. Signed integers are in two’s complement representation. Conversion between signed and unsigned integer is used in PWMMC and Term components. For more information see the documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>
             <li>Float type is used in FreeCntr8, FreeCntr16, FreeCntr32, Term, PPG, PWM, TimerInt and TimerOut components. The Compiler supports two IEEE floating point formats: IEEE32 and IEEE64. For more information see the documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>
             <li>Conversion of pointer type to integer type is used in IntFlash, IntEEPROM  components. The integer type contains 3 byte number corresponding to the pointer address. Conversion of integer type to pointer type is used in IntFlash, IntEEPROM, CPU, ExtBitIO, ExtByteIO, Ext16IO, Ext32IO, Ext8IO. The pointer points to an address represented by the integer number (far keyword is used if integer number represents global address).</li>
             <li>Unsigned char bit-field type is used. For more information on bit-fields see documented rule 3.5 in this table or the documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>
             <li>Volatile qualified variables are used to access peripheral registers (memory mapped).</li>
             <li>#include "HeaderName" directive is used to include header files generated to the project. #include &lt;HeaderName&gt; directive is used to include CodeWarrior library header files. Nesting levels for #include files is 512. For more information see the documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>
             <li>Pragma directives are used and commented in the source code. See also documented rule 3.4 in this table.</li>
             <li>Following CodeWarrior library header files are used: hidef.h (Device Initialization), limits.h (TimeDate component), stddef.h (ADC component)</li>
             <li>Inline keyword is used in AsynchroSerial, AsynchroMaster and AsynchroSlave component. All calls of inline function are replaced by the code of this function, if possible. For more information see the documentation of CodeWarrior S12(X) Build tools.</li>

             <li>#pragma CODE_SEG __NEAR_SEG NON_BANKED - places the code into non-banked memory area.</li>
             <li>#pragma CODE_SEG [SegmentName] - where [SegmentName] is identifier of the memory segment. Places the code into specified memory area. For all PE components this directive selects DEFAULT memory area.</li>
             <li>#pragma DATA_SEG [SegmentName] - where [SegmentName] is identifier of the memory segment. Places the data into specified memory area. For all PE components this directive selects DEFAULT memory area.</li>

             <li>Bits in byte bit-fields are allocated from the least significant bit to the most significant bit in the order of declaration.</li>
             <li>The bit-field allocation tries to avoid crossing a byte boundary whenever possible. To achieve optimized accesses, the compiler may insert some padding or gap bits to reach this. Maximum number of gap bits is set to 1 by default. Exception is register header files (IO_Map.h) where maximum number of gap bits is unlimited (4294967295).</li>

==========

This directory contains a simple example how to script HI-WAVE from PERL.

Note that in order to run PERL scripts you need PERL installed on your machine.
(e.g. see http://www.perl.com).

Please see inside the .pl file for additional information (as you need to do adaptations for your own environment).

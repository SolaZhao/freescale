----------

This directory contains the Visual Basic Script file (build_all.vbs) which scans and
builds all *.mcp (CodeWarrior Project Files) in a given subdirectory tree and reports
the result.

Simply launch the *.vbs file (e.g. from the Windows Explorer or from a DOS shell).
It will pop up a dialog where you can copy/paste/enter the directory to scan.

Note that the registered version of CodeWarrior IDE is used. If you have multiple
versions of CodeWarrior installed on your machine, make sure you register the one
you want to use by executing the 'regservers.bat' file in the 'bin' folder.

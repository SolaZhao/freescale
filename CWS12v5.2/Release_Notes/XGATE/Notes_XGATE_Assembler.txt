RELEASE NOTES XGATE Assembler

RELEASE NOTES AXGATE V5.0.4

  List of new Features
  - license checkouts have been removed for features included in special edition license file.

  List of fixed Bugs
  - MTWX20634: when the license file is accessed using the path from the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable (i.e. there is no license.dat in the
    tool's directory or its parent, nor is there a hiware.dat license file), and a required feature expires in less than 10 days, a crash occurs.
    This bug is fixed for build numbers greater than 6088.
  - fixed "TFR RX,PC" instruction. The previous assembler did not accept "PC" as register name.
  - Fixed: the inline assembler did not handle pseudo-instructions with 16-bit immediates (e.g. LDW RD, #IMM16)

  Demo Version Limitations
    If the assembler is running in demo mode (e.g. because there is no license file), there are following limitations:
    - Total code size for source file is limited to 1K.


RELEASE NOTES AXGATE V5.0.3

  List of new Features
  - support of the XGATE "TFR RX,PC" instruction.
  - default address space has been changed to the XGATE address space

  List of fixed Bugs
  - Opening files from the builtin Windows GUI with double clicking did cause a crash 
    if the File->Configuration->Editor Settings dialog was configured as "CodeWarrior (with COM)" and if an old IDE 4.1 was 
    configured as current CodeWarrior IDE to be used. It did work as expected with if any
    more recent CodeWarrior IDE was registered.
  - fixups to 5 bit offsets were checked as signed and therefore the linker issued overflow messages for offsets 16..31 which are legal.
  - branch offset fixups were off by 2 in the previous version. Offsets computed by the assembler on its own were correct.
    But as soon as a link time fixup was necessary for a relative branch, the offset was not correctly issued by the assembler.
  - relative branch fixups were calculated in the HCS12X logical address space. 
    This caused incorrect out of range errors of the objects were on different logical HC12 pages (but actually close enough in the XGATE address space).
    Note: this change requires the use of a recent linker. Older linkers will issue "unknown fixup" errors.

RELEASE NOTES AXGATE V5.0.2

  List of new Features
  - The assembler supports now license lingering. Lingering time is 10 minutes to allow caching of licenses (to reduce compilation time).
  - Mapping unknown messages is now treated as warning and no longer as error. This change allows to maintain compatibility with old build tools when removing no longer used messages.

  List of fixed Bugs
  - none.


RELEASE NOTES AXGATE V5.0.1

  List of new Features since alpha 2
  - 1-54681434: New option -LicWait. If set and used with floating license configuration, if no license is available from the license server,
    it will wait until a license is available. This is useful if you want to wait until a license is free, e.g. with batch jobs.
  - the assembler now uses the official ELF ID EM_XGATE with value 115.
  - the assembler generated DWARF debug information does now contain a user defined attribute with number 0x3120 with content "XGATE" in the compilation unit tag.
    This attribute can be used to differentiate HCS12X compilation units from XGATE compilation units in ELF files containing code from
    both cores.

  List of new Features
  - This is the first, initial release of the XGATE Assembler.
  - For absolute assembly use Logical addresses:
     ORG $1000 LOGICAL
    For extensibility with future releases the LOGICAL is mandatory in this alpha release.
    This could possibly change in future releases.
    (Note: without logical addresses especially the debug information won't work as expected).
  - Use the following syntax to load a XGATE address space address:
    %XGATE_8(label)    : bit 0..7 address of XGATE address space from logical address space label
    %XGATE_8_H(label)  : bit 8..15 address of XGATE address space from logical address space label
    %XGATE_16(label)   : bit 0..15 address of XGATE address space from logical address space label

    E.g.
    label:
    LDL R2,#%XGATE_8(label)
    LDH R2,#%XGATE_8_H(label)
  - The same syntax exists also for GLOBAL and Logical addresses (%GLOBAL_8(label), %LOGICAL_8(label), ....).
  - the XGATE compiler does automatically add a __X_ prefix to every function name. 
    Assembly code calling C functions or exporting functions for use in C have to add this prefix manually.
    Note: This is done for linking with a HC12 application to avoid name collisions with HC12 code.

  - Support of absolute assembly
  - Support for relocatable assembly.
  - the generated object files can be linked with HCS12X initialization code into one application containing the complete code.
  - FLEXlm support for BORROWING. Note that BORROWING is only available for floating licenses, and may be sold
    as a separate product or for an additional fee. BORROWING is used so you can work with a floating license
    even if you are disconnected from the licensing server. See FLEXlm user manuals for details on BORROWING.
    Note that this product needs a FLEXlm daemon (metrowks.exe on the licensing server) with following
    version information:
    FLEXlm v8.4a (lmgr.lib), Copyright (c) 1988-2003 by Macrovision Corporation. All rights reserved.
    The latest FLEXlm floating server software can as well be downloaded from the www.metrowerks.com
    web page, or get in touch with support to get the latest version.
  - In case of an expire/evaluation license, you are now warned 10 days before the license expires.
    The warning dialog box pops up once every day.
  - The about box (and option -Lic) shows now as well borrowing status (same as lmborrow.exe -status)
  - New option -LicBorrow:
    -LicBorrow    Borrow license feature (-LicBorrow<feature>:<Date>, <Date> in dd-mmm-yyyy[:hh:mm] format and 
    time in 24-hour hh:mm format)
    It enables selective borrowing of features (supported by the application). Note that borrowing is only supported
    if enabled in the license file by the BORROW keyword.

  List of fixed Bugs
  - None, this is the initial release.

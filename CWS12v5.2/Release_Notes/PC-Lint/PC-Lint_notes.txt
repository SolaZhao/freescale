RELEASE NOTE CodeWarrior PC-lint Plug-Ins V1.0

Introduction

  This is the first release of the PC-lint plugins for CodeWarrior. PC-lint is a product of 
  Gimple (www.gimpel.com), which has to be installed separately. This plug-in 
  interfaces the PC-lint with CodeWarrior in a simple and easy way.
  Following files are installed/needed for this:
  -	CodeWarrior help\CWPCLINTO.HLP: PC-lint options help (CodeWarrior tool tips)
  -	CodeWarrior help\ CWPCLINTS.HLP: PC-lint main help (CodeWarrior tool tips)
  -	Bin\plugins\Compiler\PCLintCompiler.dll: Compiler plug-in
  -	Bin\plugins\Linker\PCLintLinker.dll: Linker plug-in
  -	Bin\plugins\Preference Panel\PCLintOptions.dll: options preference panel
  -	Bin\plugins\Preference Panel\PCLintSettings.dll: settings preference panel
  -	Lint\lnt\CodeWarrior\*.lnt: lint configuration files
  The implementation assumes that you have the PC-lint software installed in the Lint 
  folder inside CodeWarrior. If not, then you have to adapt the path settings in the PC-
  lint settings of the preference panels.
  Note: to use the PC-lint Plug-in, a special license is required.

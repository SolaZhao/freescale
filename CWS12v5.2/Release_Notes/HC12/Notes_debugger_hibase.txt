==================================
Debugger Engine hibase.dll v6.1.67
==================================

List of New Features
--------------------
- Quoted strings may now contain also control characters according to the ANSI-C standard
(H-TAB, V-TAB, FORM-FEED). The escape sequence '\"' is interpreted and leaves the '"' in the string
constant, all the other escape sequences are not interpreted. In addition, string constants following 
each other are concatenated into one single string constants (also according to ANSI-C standard).

- Markpoints: 
Markpoints is a new entity which has been added to the 8/16 bits Metrowerks debugger in order to give 
the user the ability to mark a line code, variable, memory area and to keep trace of it. 

.Markpoints are a help for the user in order to retrieve a specific information. 

.Four kinds of Markpoints are available: Instruction, R/W Access, Read Access and Write Access, typically: 
An Instruction Markpoint has been set through the Source or Assembly component to mark a specific line of 
code or a specific instruction, 
A R/W Access, a Read Access or a Write Access Markpoint has been set through the Memory or Data component, 
to mark a specific address in the derivative memory area or to mark a variable. 

.Markpoints can be stored according to the application name, in a file (.mrk) 
and automatically retrieved on a next debugging session. 

.Markpoints can be set from the debugger Source, Assembly, Memory and Data component using pop up menus.

.Markpoints are visible by the user, with a blue icon in the Source and Assembly components and a blue line in the Memory and Data components.

- Controlpoints configuration dialog:
The Watchpoints and Breakpoints dialos have been suppressed and replaced with the Controlpoints configuration dialog. 
.Controlpoints configuration dialog, Breakpoints tab allows to manage the Breakpoints
.Controlpoints configuration dialog, Watchpoints tab allows to manage the Watchpoints 
.Controlpoints configuration dialog, Markpoints tab allows to manage the Markpoints (save, view, add, delete, …).
.This dialog allows to modify a Markpoint attributes: address, name, size or kind.
.The Show Location button allows to view in the debugger, as an example, the source line where is set an Instruction Markpoint 
or a Breakpoint in the Source component.

==================================
Debugger Engine hibase.dll v6.1.66
==================================

List of New Features
--------------------
- none.


List of Fixed Bugs
--------------------
- Improvements in the “Set Target Dialog”: now opens on the CPU and target it reads in the project file, if any.
- WB1-36457.


List of Known Bugs
--------------------
- none.


==================================
Debugger Engine hibase.dll v6.1.65
==================================

List of New Features
--------------------
- This version uses a new FLEXlm daemon (the Metrowerks one). If you already have a license for the former version, 
you need to upgrade your license. Additionally be aware that in compliance with other Metrowerks tools the license 
(license.dat) file in the installation root (e.g. c:\metrowerks\license.dat, the installation script has created a 
shortcut to this file) is used. If such a license.dat exists, this file is used to check out the license. Only if 
this file does not exist, the one in C:\FLEXlm is used. 

- Set Target dialog:
The dialog opens now on the Target Interface and the CPU defined in your project file. If there is no target file defined,
it will open on the Simulator Target Interface. If there is no CPU defined, the CPU combo box displays “Unknown”, and you
have to choose a CPU.


List of Fixed Bugs
--------------------
- none.


List of Known Bugs
--------------------
- In HIWARE format, the module name is now coded with the following extension: “.c.o”. This is responsible for generating 
an error message when using the SMOD command line command: “this is not a module of the application currently loaded”. 
This command is often used by the Recorder component, this means that such a recording session may be broken due to this fact.

==================================
Debugger Engine hibase.dll v6.1.63
==================================

List of New Features
--------------------
- Set target dialog:
The target interfaces are displayed according to the selected CPU. A text field informs about the supported hardware with 
this configuration ( CPU + Target Interface).
All Dll of the target interfaces have to be loaded in order to get the clue of which CPU they support. This may take a long 
time, so a progress bar has been implemented.

- Open Component Dialog:
The new Open Component dialog supports an “explorer like” view of the components . The components may be displayed as Large Icons, 
List of Icons, Details. This last view contains a field that is a short description of the component.
The dialog opens up on the last selected view.
The short description’s field uses an external file for the moment. It is located in the “ApplicationDir”\resources directory, 
as well as the icons files.
In the future, all these resources may be included in the component resources, provided that the speed does not decrease too much.

- The simulator cycle counter has been extended from 32 to 64 bits allowing larger simulation sequences.


List of Fixed Bugs
--------------------
- none.

- The license file is searched in following order: 
license.dat in the directory where the executable is (this was already the case) 
hiware.lic in the directory where the executable is (this was already the case) 
license.dat in one directory up from the where the executable is (this is new. E.g. if the executable is in c:\metrowerks\prog, the license 
file in c:\metrowerks is searched too) 
the license file using the normal FLEXlm way (usually c:\flexlm, this was already the case)

- The Open Window component dialog has been extended with a Browse button allowing to load a component located outside of the \prog directory.

- The Open IO Component dialog has been extended with a Browse button allowing to load a peripheral located outside of the \prog directory. 

- For peripheral development purpose, the following messages are now sent to all components:
MSG_START_LOADING is sent right before the code is loaded,
MSG_END_LOADING is sent right after the code has been loaded.

- Environment variables now support the following new macros (case sensitive): 
{Project} 
the variable is replaced with the path of the current project file, e.g if the current project file is “C:\Metrowerks\Examples\HC08\project.ini”, 
then the following definition “{Project}bin” is resolved to “C:\Metrowerks\Examples\HC08\bin”

execute other debugger operations. HIWARE IDF is furthermore following HI-WAVE debugger in its operation since it is always in the same file 
and on the same line as the debugger. The communication between HIWARE IDF and HI-WAVE is performed via DDE.

- New DDE features. The debugger now implements a DDE Server allowing an external application to execute all available commands through DDE 
protocol (with service name “HI-WAVE” and topic name “Command”). A DDE client is also implemented in order to exchange synchronization 
informations with HIWARE IDF.

- New License Management with FLEXlm 2.0 involving lmgr327a.dll 

- New command line instructions: 
RESTART: 	Restarts the loaded application at his entry point.
STEPOVER: 	Steps over the statement of a procedure during the debugging process of the loaded application 
STEPINTO: 	Steps to the next source instruction during the debugging process of the loaded application 
STEPOUT: 	Executes the program out of a function call, and stops on the instruction immediately following the call to the function during 
the debugging process of the loaded application 
STOP: 	Alias from the S command : stop the execution of the current application

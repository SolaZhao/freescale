RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.13

List of New Features
- license checkouts have been removed for features included in special edition license file.
- Mapping unknown messages is now treated as warning and no longer as error. This change allows to maintain compatibility with old build tools when removing no longer used messages.
- 1-54681434: New option -LicWait. If set and used with floating license configuration, if no license is available from the license server,
  it will wait until a license is available. This is useful if you want to wait until a license is free, e.g. with batch jobs.
- The about box (and option -Lic) shows now as well borrowing status (same as lmborrow.exe -status)
- New option -LicBorrow:
  -LicBorrow    Borrow license feature (-LicBorrow<feature>:<Date>, <Date> in dd-mmm-yyyy[:hh:mm] format and 
  time in 24-hour hh:mm format)
  It enables selective borrowing of features (supported by the application). Note that borrowing is only supported
  if enabled in the license file by the BORROW keyword.
- In case of an expire/evaluation license, you are now warned 10 days before the license expires.
  The warning dialog box pops up once every day.
- FLEXlm support for BORROWING. Note that BORROWING is only available for floating licenses, and may be sold
  as a separate product or for an additional fee. BORROWING is used so you can work with a floating license
  even if you are disconnected from the licensing server. See FLEXlm user manuals for details on BORROWING.
  Note that this product needs a FLEXlm daemon (metrowks.exe on the licensing server) with following
  version information:
  FLEXlm v8.4a (lmgr.lib), Copyright (c) 1988-2003 by Macrovision Corporation. All rights reserved.
  The latest FLEXlm floating server software can as well be downloaded from the www.metrowerks.com
  web page, or get in touch with support to get the latest version.

List of Fixed Bugs
- MTWX20634: when the license file is accessed using the path from the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable (i.e. there is no license.dat in the
  tool's directory or its parent, nor is there a hiware.dat license file), and a required feature expires in less than 10 days, a crash occurs.
  This bug is fixed for build numbers greater than 6088.
- Opening files from the builtin Windows GUI with double clicking did cause a crash 
  if the File->Configuration->Editor Settings dialog was configured as "CodeWarrior (with COM)" and if an old IDE 4.1 was 
  configured as current CodeWarrior IDE to be used. It did work as expected with if any
  more recent CodeWarrior IDE was registered.
- 1-49543661: undefByte was only used for the first SENDBYTE if the content of multiple SENDBYTE's was put into the same binary output file.

List of Known Bugs
- none.

Demo Version Limitations
- If the Burner is running in Demo Mode (e.g. no valid license file), there is following 
  limitation: Total code size is limited to 1024 bytes for 8/16bit CPU's and 3KByte of 
  code for 32bit CPUs.

RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.12

- none.
List of Known Bugs
- none.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.11
List of New Features
- new option -Ns=p to remove the path out of the file name present in the S0 record.
List of Fixed Bugs
- Fixed memory overwrite bug for macro expansion which generated lines > 256 chars. 
  E.g. for CW projects with very long abs file names
- R2917: comments in the burner files, if there was a '*' inside the comment like '/***/', 
  the rest of the file was handled to be in comment too.
List of Known Bugs
- The burner does not allow to use files/paths with a # in their name. The burner does 
  automatically replace any occurrence of a # with the current value of the built-in 
  variable i. Note: This behavior is documented in the manual. Its purpose is to handle 
  automatically multiple files.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.10
List of New Features
- This version uses a new FLEXlm daemon (the Metrowerks one). If you already have a 
  license for the former version, you need to upgrade your license. Additionally be 
  aware that in compliance with other Metrowerks tools the license (license.dat) file in 
  the installation root (e.g. c:\metrowerks\license.dat, the installation script has created 
  a shortcut to this file) is used. If such a license.dat exists, this file is used to check out 
  the license. Only if this file does not exist, the one in C:\FLEXlm is used.
- R2856: HEX386 (32bit Intel HEX files were only supported up to 20bit addresses). 
  This release supports now up to 32bit addresses. Note that to handle this 32bit Intel 
  Hex files you need a Decoder V5.0.11 (or later) and in the simulator/debugger a 
  Hexloader V6.1.13 (or later).
List of Fixed Bugs
- none.
List of Known Bugs
- none.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.09
List of New Features
- New option –Ns. With this option the S0, S7, S8 or S9 records can be suppressed in 
  the generated S-Record file. As an example this option can be used together with a 
  non-standard S-Record that does not understand the S0 record.
- This version of the burner contains the feature that the code size limitation can be 
  controlled by FLEXlm. In this case and if such a license is present, this will show up 
  in the about box.
List of Fixed Bugs
- Handling of ELF files with sections of size 0.
- In case of running into demo limitation, the Burner did not issue correctly a message 
  under CodeWarrior.
List of Known Bugs
- none.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.08
List of New Features
- The new macro ABS_FILE is supported in burner environment. This macro will be 
  automatically replaced by the application filename.
  Example:  
  OPENFILE "%ABS_FILE%.s19" 
  SENDBYTE 1 "%ABS_FILE%"
  In this way, when the application filename is modified in the generic settings of the 
  linker in Code Warrior, the input and output of the burner stay coherent. 
- Following special macros are supported now in the environment too: {Compiler}, 
  {Project} and {System}.
  Note: Those macros are newly available during environment variable substitution.
  They are not automatically supported in filenames in general.
- R2652: It is possible now to change the color for messages in the tool window. It can 
  be changed for WARNING, INFORMATION, ERROR, FATAL and for user 
  messages as well. Following options are available for this: -WmsgCW, -WmsgCI, -
  WmsgCE, -WmsgCF and -WmsgCU. See manual for details.
List of Fixed Bugs
- none.
List of Known Bugs
- none.
Demo Version Limitations
- If the Burner is running in Demo Mode (e.g. no valid license file), there is following 
  limitation: Total code size is limited to 1024 bytes


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.07
List of New Features
- New option -ShowAboutDialog to show the about dialog
- All tools have now a dialog to edit the environment (File->Configuration). E.g. to 
  modify the GENPATH.  Note that this affects the project file only (and does NOT 
  support the default.env)
- The license file is searched in following order: 
- license.dat in the directory where the executable is (this was already the case) 
- hiware.lic in the directory where the executable is (this was already the case) 
- license.dat in one directory up from the where the executable is (this is new. E.g. if  
  the executable is in c:\metrowerks\prog, the license file in c:\metrowerks is searched 
  too) 
- the license file using the normal FLEXlm way (usually c:\flexlm, this was already 
  the case)
List of Fixed Bugs
- none.
List of Known Bugs
- none.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.06
List of New Features
- R2401: The "show dialog" speed button on the toolbar does now have fly-by-help (tool tip).
- R2402: The "select destination file" dialog launched from the burner dialog 
  input/output tab does have now a file type filter for intel hex (.hex).
- R2403: In the "select destination file" dialog, the default file type filter always sets to 
  the format (SRecord, binary or intel hex) which has been set in the Content Tab.
List of Fixed Bugs
- R2447: Burner crash for binary format sent to COM ports.
List of Known Bugs
- none.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.05
List of New Features
- The SRECORD command is now supported in the graphical dialog too
- New command SLINELEN to specify the length of each S-Record
- Color for output is now used: e.g. error messages are written in red
- New startup option –NoEnv which disables the usage of the environment 
  (default.env, tips file and project.ini)
List of Fixed Bugs
- R2336: "-F=fibo.bbl" did not work. However, the form "–F fibo.bbl" did work. 
  Now the following forms are legal: 
  Direct all commands on the command line: 'OPENFILE "fibo.out" format=motorola 
  busWidth=4 origin=0 len=0x10000000 destination=0 swapByte=yes SENDBYTE 1 
  "fibo.abs" CLOSE' 
– option –f with argument '-f=fibo.bbl' 
– option –f separated with argument: '-f fibo.bbl' 
  Anything before a –f, which is not an option is taken as command. Once a command 
  started, the rest of the command line is used as additional commands. 
  So 'fibo.bbl –f' does not work because there is no command 'fibo.bbl'. To burn 
  fibo.bbl, use '-f=fibo.bbl'.
- R2294: All entries on page one of the burner dialog did become active only after 
  closing the dialog or selecting another page.
- The parity communication setting does not work on all PC machines.
- R2372: The serial port feature did not work.
List of Known Bugs
- None.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.04

  entries in HIWARE format. For the ELF format, also previous versions of the 
  burner did order their output.
List of Fixed Bugs
- R2240: Endless loop for illegal absolute file.
- Burner V5.0.2 did write empty files.
- Files dragged onto the burner and files selected with the menu entry file->Burn are 
  now treated as command file.
List of Known Bugs
- The parity communication setting does not work on all PC machines.


RELEASE NOTES Burner V5.0.03

RELEASE NOTES HI-CROSS Burner V2.7.12
List of New Features
- New Variable 'undefByte' defined for the batch mode of the burner (option -w) and 
  for command files. In binary output mode you can define the value for an undefined 
  byte over this variable. Default is 0xFF.
  Example 	
	  undefByte := 0	/* Sets the undefined byte value for binary output to 0 */
  This feature is not available for the interactive mode of the Burner.
List of Fixed Bugs
- None.
List of Known Bugs
- None.

RELEASE NOTES HI-CROSS Burner V2.7.11
List of New Features
- New MCUTOOLS.INI: All tools store now their global information instead in the 
  HICROSS.INI file in the windows directory in a file called MCUTOOLS.INI. 
  Below a short extract from the manual:
	  MCUTOOLS.INI File (PC only)
	  All tools may store some global data into the MCUTOOLS.INI. The tool first 
  searches for this file in the directory of the tool itself (path of the executable). If 
  there is no MCUTOOLS.INI file in this directory, the tool looks for a 
  MCUTOOLS.INI file located in the MS Windows installation directory (e.g. 
  C:\WINDOS).
	  Example:
	  C:\WINDOWS\MCUTOOLS.INI
	  D:\INSTALL\PROG\MCUTOOLS.INI
	  If a tool is started in the D:\INSTALL\PROG\DIRECTOY, the project file in the 
  same directory than the tool is used (D:\INSTALL\PROG\MCUTOOLS.INI).
	  But if the tool is started outside the D:\INSTALL\PROG directory, the project 
  file in the Windows directory is used (C:\WINDOWS\MCUTOOLS.INI).
- The HICROSS.INI file is not used any more. It can be renamed to 
  MCUTOOLS.INI, because the format remains the same.
List of Fixed Bugs
- None.
List of Known Bugs
- None.

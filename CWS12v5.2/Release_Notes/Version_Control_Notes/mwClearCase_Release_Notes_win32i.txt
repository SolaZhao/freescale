Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 5.1.1 or later.

Changes since version 1.1.2
=========================
Version 1.1.3 fixes defect MTWX14875 where comments where not being allowed
during check-out

Changes since version 1.1
=========================
Version 1.1.2 is a maintenance release to address several defects and 
design limitations present in version 1.1.

1) In version 1.1.2, the VCS Settings panel behaves differently than in 
previous versions.  After choosing MW ClearCase as the version control method, 
all of the controls are disabled accept the Choose local and network path 
button.  For dynamic views, the local path needs to be set to your view 
directory.  For example if your current view is "my_view" the VOB is mounted 
on M:, your local path is M:\my_view.  For snapshot views, the local path
needs to be set to your local snapshot residing on a physical disk and the
network path needs to be set to the current view located on a VOB that the
snapshot is taken from.

2) It is longer necessary to login to ClearCase with a user name and password.
This behavior has been eliminated.

3) Recursive commands have been removed.  Testing revealed that these features
contains several design flaws that could impact the user in a negative manner.
In this release, they have been removed.

4) The Add Project command ( VCS > Project > Add ) will not allow you to add
the current project to ClearCase.  An informative message displayed in the 
Message Window referring you to this document or technical support.  The
Project Add command was disabled due to problems that can be encountered when
adding a project file to a view with elements checked out by another user as
reserved.  In this situation, ClearCase may move the project file while it is 
open and not restore it to it's original location.  The CodeWarrior IDE does
not support relocation of the project file or the project's data folder while
the project is open at this time.

5) An error message raised by ClearCase when running on Windows NT relating to
Thread Local Storage has been addressed.  Previous version of this plugin were
loaded and unloaded often and unnecessarily by the IDE.  This caused the 
ClearCase DLLs to be loaded and unloaded often resulting in Thread Local 
Storage error messages. Although on NT, Thread Local Storage issues can still 
happen, they should be rare occurrences.  Later version of the Windows 
Operations system have improved TLS capabilities.
 

Known issues:
=============
1) The VCS menu contains a menu item called Connect.  Upon successful 
connection the menu item name changes to Disconnect.  Normally, the IDE
will automatically connect the IDE to the ClearCase system automatically and 
the menu item will say Disconnect.

However in some instances, the IDE can become disconnected from the ClearCase 
system.  In this situation, you must choose Connect in the VCS menu to use the 
ClearCase commands in the VCS menu.

There is no reason to choose Disconnect from the VCS menu.  Connect simply 
tells the ClearCase library that the integration has started.  There is no
ClearCase concept or command associated with Connect and Disconnect, rather 
they are artifacts of the integration.

2) Some informational messages may be displayed in the message window that 
are unnecessary or overly vague.

3) It is important that the VCS settings match the Clear Case settings for
files under source control.  Unexpected behavior can occur if the VCS setting
are for a one VOB and an attempt is made to perform an action on a file in a 
different VOB.
